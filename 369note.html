      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
         The course covers the operating system as a control program and
         resource allocator; processes, threads, and concurrency; memory
         management; file systems; and protection. It is one of the requirment
         for all computer science specialists.

          <h4>Intro to OS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Regard OS as: abstraction provider, resource manager, program controller</li>
            <li>Kernel mode: Core to operating system, had the permission to
              access the OS. Normal prorgams are in user mode, which cannot access to the OS</li>
            <li>About the storage: </li>
            <li><img src="imgs/storage.png" alt="storage" style="width:50%;height:50%;"> </li>
            <li>Concurrency: problem caused by multiple processes executes concurrently.</li>

        <div class="block" id="process">
          <h4>Processes and threads</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Process: a prorgam in exexution, its like a container that
              contains all <strong>execution states</strong> of program in execution, and
              is named by the PID</li>
            <li><img src="imgs/state_program.png" alt="programs state" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></li>
            <li>Process Control Block(PCB): process's data structure, contains
              all info about process, where OS keep all process' execution
              state(see the picture) when process not running</li>
            <li>Process state: ready/ blocked/ running</li>
            <li><img src="imgs/state.png" alt="state" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></li>
            <li>State queues: OS keep track of processes by a collection of queues, one queue for each state</li>
            <li><img src="imgs/state_queue.png" alt="state queue" style="width:50%;height:50%;"></li>
            <li>Context switch: switch the CPU to another process, save state of old process, load saved state for new process</li>
            <li>Opreations on processes:
              <ul>
                <li>process creation: process created by another process, fork (review in CSC209)</li>
                <li>process termination</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Parallel prorgams: create several processes that execute in parallel/ shared memoru for processes to share data, OS schedule these processes in parallel. parallel program is <strong>INEFFICIENT</strong></li>
            <li>Parallel prorgams => cooperating processes share:<ul>
              <li>same code and data</li>
              <li>same privileges (what does that mean?)</li>
              <li>same resources</li>
            </ul>not share:<ul>
              <li>execution states like PC SP registers</li>
            </ul></li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="block" id="threads">
          <h4>Intro to Threads</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Thread: defines a sequential execution stream within a process (PC, SP, registers). Bound to a single process, but sinle process can have multiple threads. Processes are containers in which threads execute.</li>
            <li>Thread interface(Pthread API)</li>
            <li>Thread scheduling => scheduler determines when a thread runs. Uses queues to keep track of what threads are doing. Run queue/ ready queue</li>
          </ul>
